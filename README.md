# maize-yield-prediction
Machine Learning powered maize yield prediction system for smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe."
A machine learning-based system designed to predict maize crop yields for smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe. The project leverages historical weather and soil data to assist farmers in making informed agricultural decisions, aiming to contribute towards restoring Zimbabwe as the "breadbasket of Africa."

# Project Overview

This system predicts expected maize yield based on:
- Historical weather data
- Soil characteristics
- Regional farming practices

### Objectives
